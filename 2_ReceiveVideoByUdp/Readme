Parameters are python3 2_.py -p 5000 -a 2 -v OpenCV

-v may be OpenCV or videosink
videosink is delays video when sending second time from client
without receiver restart
OpenCV has not such issues but had more complexity
videosource is i420(YUV420p) which actualy is YV12
OPENCV -> RGB
[0-size] - is Y location
[size-size*1.25] - V location
[size*1.25-size*1.5] - U location

-a alghoritms to decode
1 decodes it as cv2.COLOR_YCrCb2RGB
2 create YUV from formula above and convert YUV to RGB
3 decodes it as flow reshape linear to [1.5*height, width] and convert into native YUV420p2RGB
